Bottle is a browser that lets you surf the Bitcoin network for these things, and brings them all together through Bitcoin native URI schemes such as [B://](https://b.bitdb.network) or [C://](https://c.bitdb.network) (or any other protocols we add in the future).

Note that the address bar below uses a b:// address:, not HTTP or HTTPS. This HTML file is 100% hosted and served from the Bitcoin blockchain, and has nothing to do with where a "server" is located.
